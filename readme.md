# Labs ðŸª´
Just a place to centralise ideas for libraries or abstractions of features I find interesting and may use later on (I probably won't). If you are interested in knowing the motivation for an idea, click on the links to read more about it.

## [Safe Web Storage API](./safe-storage/)
A type-safe and runtime-safe abstraction to use the native `window.localStorage` and `window.sessionStorage` browser APIs.


## [Environment](./environment/)
This script throws an error when finds environment variables that were not initialized on the `.env` files but are being used in your project.


## [Clean `package.json`](./clean-package-json/)
A script that removes all properties from your <code>package.json</code> you don't want to ship when publishing releases of your open-source library.
