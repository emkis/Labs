# Labs ðŸª´
A repo to centralise ideas I have for libraries or cool abstractions I think would be helpful in some use cases, and may want to use later on in a project.

> Every idea has its folder, inside each folder, there is more information about why I think the idea is useful and what motivated me to think about building them.
